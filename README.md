# Purpose
Simple app to explore the contents exposed by the public API of Statistics Sweden (www.scb.se/en), a government agency responsible for producing official statistics regarding Sweden.
# How to Use
Select first language and then topics until a page with possible filter values is shown. Select at least one value per filter and then press *Submit*. A table with the results is shown.
At any time you can close the current page and go back to the previous one by pressing the x in the top right corner.
# N.B.
The server exposing the API doesn't handle preflight calls well so you'll need to help the browser along a bit by, for instance, installing an extension that handles CORS.
# Planned Improvements
* Plot graphs of numeric data
* Cache results
